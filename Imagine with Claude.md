# Imagine with Claude

Anthropic has an experiment/preview app builder called "Imagine with Claude". It's a research preview to explore user interaction, it doesn't build persistent apps. The user says what they want an app to do, and Imagine with Claude makes the first screen. The user interacts with the "app" by, say, clicking a button, and Claude builds the view you'd expect to see after clicking the button. It doesn't persist data, really, but it does pretend that it does; so, if you have a blank list of people, then add a person on a new screen, when you return to the list of people you'll see your new person.

It's new and different and kinda interesting.

Only certain higher-tier Claude accounts have access.
