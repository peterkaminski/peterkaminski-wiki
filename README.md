## Welcome to peterkaminski.wiki

This is my wiki.

It’s where I put things I don’t want to rush, flatten, or perform into shape.

Some of what’s here started as a question I couldn’t quite let go of. Some of it is careful, slow thinking that didn’t belong on a blog. Some of it is simply knowledge I wanted to keep around: notes, references, diagrams, half-finished ideas that are complete enough to stand on their own, even if they never turn into anything else.

Not everything needs to become an essay.  
Not everything needs an audience.  
Some work is valuable just because it exists.

That’s what this place is for.

---

I maintain a few different sites, each for a different purpose.

**peterkaminski.ai** is where my public work lives—writing that’s ready to carry weight, invite conversation, or help others place my thinking.

**peterkaminski.com** is a simple calling card, a stable way to find me and route elsewhere.

This site, **peterkaminski.wiki**, is something else entirely. It’s closer to a workshop or an attic. A place for things that are intellectually coherent but not trying to do coordination or positioning work. A place where ideas can sit quietly and compound over time.

If something here eventually earns its way outward, that’s fine. Most things won’t, and that’s fine too.

---

You’ll find a mix of material here: systems thinking, knowledge-management experiments, historical notes, craft write-ups, conceptual maps. Some pages are tidy. Some are rough. Some may go untouched for long stretches.

That’s not neglect, it’s how this space is meant to work.

If you want to explore, **Recent Changes**, **All Pages**, and **Search** are the best ways in. There isn’t a guided tour, and there doesn’t need to be one.

Think of this less as a publication and more as browsing someone’s shelves.

If you find something useful here, I’m glad.  
If you’re just passing through, that’s fine too.

Welcome.
