Hi, I'm <a class="h-card" href="https://peterkaminski.wiki/"><img style="display:none" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/016ee606d10556118cc8cbc603f1ef7ed65c3f7d55a8a736e463952aedcea6cd" alt="Photograph of Peter Kaminski, loaded from Gravatar." />Peter Kaminski</a>. Welcome to my wiki.

I'm moving to this wiki website from [peterkaminski.com](http://peterkaminski.com/), where I haven't been posting actively for years and years. I look forward to resuming more active wiki-blogging here, but for now, I've barely set the site up.

For now, use the "All Pages" and "Search" at the top of the pages to navigate.

This wiki is built and maintained using [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) tools and patterns.

To find out how to get in touch, click the "Contact Peter Kaminski" link at the left, or my name at the bottom of any page here.

Look for more as this wiki grows!
