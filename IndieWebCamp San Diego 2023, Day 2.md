# IndieWebCamp San Diego 2023, Day 2

Day 2 was building.

Here were my goals:

* {{peterkaminski}}
	* [x] put Federated Auth Network deets in #dev (hoping the IW and FAN communities bump into each other a little more)
	* [x] show {{ihudson}} how to get a website up with MasWiki - <http://complicatedstatus.com/>
	* [ ] work on setting up [[https://indieweb.org/Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) Webmention] send and/or receive to/from Massive Wiki
		* [x] Webmention sent from [https://developer.massive.wiki/working_on_webmention,_2023-12-17](https://developer.massive.wiki/working_on_webmention,_2023-12-17) to [https://ragt.ag](https://ragt.ag/) using [https://telegraph.p3k.io/](https://telegraph.p3k.io/)

And links:

- test page for sending: [Working on Webmention, 2023-12-17 - Developer Wiki (Massive Wiki)](https://developer.massive.wiki/working_on_webmention,_2023-12-17)
- other senders: [https://mention.tech/](https://mention.tech/) [https://webmention.app/](https://webmention.app/)
- could use YAML frontmatter to add title and stuff, which would keep from having to mark up the title in the page
- great 11ty how-to: [https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/)
