# Obsidian Settings

Some of my favorite plugins for [[Obsidian]].

Also see [[Obsidian Community Plugins]] and [[Obsidian Utilities]].

## Appearance

### Interface

- **Show inline title:** off. My convention is to have the page title as an H1 inside each page, which is useful for other tools in my Markdown ecosystem. Inline title is redundant and confusing if there's an H1 with the page title.

## Editing

### Display

- **Readable line length:** off. When I make my Obsidian window wide, I want the text to spread out wide, too. If I need the line length to be narrower for readability, I just change the window width.
