## If one were careful...

If one were careful, they might notice the small blue door nestled between the bakery and bookshop on Marigold Lane. Most people hurried past, eyes fixed on phones or watches, minds already at their destinations. Sarah had walked this street a thousand times before noticing it on a rainy Tuesday when a puddle forced her to sidestep her usual path.

The door stood barely five feet tall, its paint peeling in places to reveal layers of previous colors – greens and reds from decades past. A small brass knob, polished by countless hands, caught the afternoon light. No sign indicated what lay beyond, only a peculiar symbol etched into the wood – something like a spiral with three branches extending outward.

Sarah hesitated. She was already late for her shift at the hospital, but curiosity tugged at her like an insistent child. Twenty years as a nurse had taught her that sometimes the most important moments came from unexpected detours. With a quick glance at her watch, she decided five minutes wouldn't matter much in the grand scheme of things. She bent slightly and turned the knob.

The door opened with surprising ease, revealing a narrow corridor lit by glass lamps emitting a warm amber glow. The walls were lined with shelves containing hundreds of small wooden boxes, each labeled with dates ranging back centuries. The air smelled of cedar, old paper, and something else – something Sarah couldn't quite place but reminded her of summer thunderstorms.

"Hello?" she called, her voice swallowed by the peculiar acoustics of the space.

A rustling sound came from further down the corridor, followed by soft footsteps. An elderly man appeared, his white hair wild and untamed, wearing a cardigan with numerous pockets, each bulging with mysterious items.

"Ah, a visitor!" he exclaimed, his eyes crinkling with delight. "We don't get many these days. People are always in such a hurry." He approached, extending a hand covered in ink stains. "I'm Arthur. Welcome to the Repository."

"The Repository?" Sarah asked, shaking his hand. "Repository of what exactly?"

Arthur smiled enigmatically. "Of moments, my dear. Moments that might have been forgotten otherwise."

He gestured for her to follow and led her deeper into the corridor, which opened into a circular room with a domed ceiling. The dome was made of stained glass depicting scenes of ordinary life – people talking in cafés, children playing in parks, an old woman feeding pigeons. The room's center held a large wooden table covered with curious instruments – magnifying glasses, tweezers of different sizes, small crystal vials, and delicate scales.

"You see," Arthur explained, pulling out one of the boxes from a nearby shelf, "most people believe time is linear, moving forward like a river. But it's more like... an ocean. Full of currents, eddies, and still pools. Some moments create ripples that affect everything around them, while others..." he opened the box to reveal what looked like a small glass marble containing swirling smoke, "remain isolated, like islands."

Sarah peered at the marble. Within the smoke, she could make out a scene – a young girl laughing as she chased butterflies in a meadow.

"Is that..." she began.

"A moment," Arthur confirmed. "June 12, 1954. Eleanor Peterson, age seven, discovered a monarch butterfly migration. This moment changed her life – she became a renowned entomologist whose work saved three butterfly species from extinction."

He returned the box to its shelf and selected another. "But we don't just collect the momentous. Sometimes the smallest moments matter most."

This marble contained the image of an elderly man sitting alone on a park bench, feeding crumbs to sparrows.

"Harold Williams, October 3, 2018. His wife of sixty years had died the previous month. This was the first moment he felt peace again. Nothing historically significant, but precious nonetheless."

Sarah's mind reeled with questions. "How do you collect these? Who decides which moments to preserve?"

Arthur chuckled. "The Repository has existed for millennia, with caretakers like myself. As for how we collect them..." he gestured to a door Sarah hadn't noticed before, "that's where my assistant comes in."

The door opened, and Sarah gasped. The woman who entered wore Sarah's face, but with subtle differences – hair slightly longer, eyes a touch greener, a small scar on her right cheek that Sarah didn't possess.

"Meet Eleanor," Arthur said. "From a different tributary of time than yours."

Eleanor smiled warmly. "Hello, Sarah. I've been waiting to meet you."

"I don't understand," Sarah whispered.

"In your timeline, you became a nurse," Eleanor explained. "In mine, I discovered the Repository when I was nineteen. Different choices, different paths."

Arthur touched Sarah's shoulder gently. "Collectors must have the ability to recognize significant moments. You've always had that gift – seeing the importance in what others overlook. That's why the door revealed itself to you today."

Sarah looked between them. "Are you saying you want me to... collect moments?"

"Your timeline's collector retired last month," Arthur said. "The Repository needs someone new. Someone careful, observant. Someone like you."

"But my job, my life..." Sarah protested weakly, even as she felt a strange rightness to this revelation.

Eleanor smiled knowingly. "Time works differently here. You can do both, if you wish."

Arthur handed Sarah a small brass key identical to the one hanging around his neck. "This opens the door from anywhere, anytime. The choice is yours."

Sarah stared at the key, weighing more than just metal in her palm. Her entire life had been devoted to preserving human life in its most vulnerable moments. Wasn't this just another form of preservation?

She closed her fingers around the key and nodded.

"I'll be careful," she promised.

"That's exactly why the Repository chose you," Arthur replied with a smile. "Now, let me show you how to capture a moment..."

As Sarah followed Arthur deeper into the Repository, the blue door on Marigold Lane closed softly behind them, once again becoming invisible to all but the most careful observers hurrying past.
