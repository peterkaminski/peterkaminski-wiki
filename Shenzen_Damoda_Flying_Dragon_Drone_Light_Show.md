Maybe you've seen the cool "flying dragon" drone light show from the June 2023 Dragon Boat Show in Hong Kong.

The company providing the drones and control system is [Shenzen Damoda](https://en.dmduav.com/). This is the [3rd generation (V3) of the Damoda drone systems](https://en.dmduav.com/item/light-show-drone/outdoor-v2-formation-uav) (tech specs, en.dmduav.com).

The dragon is cool because, well, it's a dragon! But also, it's got nice color detail, sinuous motion, and it's a great demo of the precision control they have over the drones.

Obligatory note: there are ongoing political tensions between USA, China, Shanghai, Hong Kong, etc. Consume media with due care.

Here are various videos, all hosted on YouTube. Notes: dragon videos are sped up; not all videos are necessarily from the Dragon Boat Show itself, although they show the same drone systems.
