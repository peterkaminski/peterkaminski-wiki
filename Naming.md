# Naming

[[Chunking]] breaks information into nicely sized pieces of information.

**Naming** is a way of finding and referring to a piece of information

This primarily happens at the level of the page. It can also happen at the levels of headers. 

It's good to converge towards the similar names for similar concepts. 

This helps us continue to merge and chunk the information into [[Shared Language]].
