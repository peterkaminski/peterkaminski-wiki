# Obsidian Utilities

[Obsidian Settings Manager](https://github.com/peterkaminski/obsidian-settings-manager) - command-line utility to manage Obsidian settings across multiple vaults.

With OSM, to print the community plugins for all vaults Obsidian knows about:

```shell
./osm.py -x 'cat .obsidian/community-plugins.json'
```

Also see [Massive Wiki Builder](https://github.com/Massive-Wiki/massivewikibuilder), which is a static site builder that works great with Obsidian.
