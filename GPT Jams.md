## Kinds of things you can store in Obsidian

## Ground Vehicle Types

Consider a range of ground vehicles.

- Rolls-Royce Phantom (luxury)
- Volvo S90 (premium)
- Lexus GS 350 (upper mid-range)
- Toyota Camry (mid-range practical)
- Honda Odyssey (minivan, family-friendly)
- Toyota RAV4 (SUV / crossover)
- Jeep Wrangler (off-road capable)
- HMMWV (Humvee, military / utility)
- Pierce Arrow fire engine (technical / special purpose)
- John Deere tractor (utility / heavy duty)
- PistenBully snow groomer (specialty)

Obsidian is around the Jeep Wrangler level. A great vehicle for around town and on the freeway, but has a little more customizability and technical capability than, say, a Camry. The interface is basically the same as any other car. It's less comfortable than something fancier, but lovable and easy to live with. Maybe you've added a roll bar, some jerry cans of water or fuel, a winch, KC lights, etc. You need to know how and when to use 4WD.

## Pete's "Markdown Ecosystem"

- Millions of people have their own preferred ecosystem, this is mine
- [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) - a wiki ecosystem that provides classic wiki utility, with a plurality of tools and processes that enable decentralization and federation of the pages; public benefit, not for profit
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - a personal knowledge manager that's based on Markdown files, free for personal use
- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) - a collaborative Markdown editor, free for basic features
- (above this line works for everybody, below this line it's more complicated and specialized)
  - [Typora](https://typora.io/) - clean, minimal Markdown editor, $15
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - comprehensive and confusing collaboration and version control for text files, open source
  - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and other software developer tools, open source
  - [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/), similar to Obsidian but developer-oriented
